## File for our usecases
![Use case 1](uc1.png)
This use case is about robot information and data. It demonstrates how the users access robots' information and how the database manager organizes robots' data in the backend.


![Use case 2](uc2.png)
This use case is about sending the robots to perform tasks. It demonstrates how the user uses the command-line interface to interact with the robots and how the user communicates with the robots.


![Use case 3](uc3.png)
This use case is about the building the robots operate in, and where to send the robots. The building manager is not a user because it only is setting restrictions on where the robots can go. The fleet_manager is a specific type of user who has the ability to take control of the robots if needed.
