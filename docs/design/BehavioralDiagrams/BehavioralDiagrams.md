## File for our behavioral diagrams
![AssignTask Sequence Diagram](AssignTaskSQ.png) <br>
This is a sequence diagram that is showing the steps the user would take to assign a task to a robot and the robot to go start that task.

![duringTask Sequence Diagram](duringTaskSQ.png) <br>
This is a sequence diagram that demonstrates basic steps for a robot behaviors during its task, and its interactions with the Room and Simulation class.

![makeTask Activity Diagram](makeTaskAD.png) <br>
This is a activity diagram that shows how the simulation creates a task with the user and ensures that it is a valid task.


* Henry: We all talked through the sequence diagrams for assign task and during task. I created the behavioral diagrams folder and the markdown files. I also coded the assign task plant uml file. I also cleaned up our design folder to be for all behavioral diagrams and updated our markdown file.
* Lauren: I created the makeTask Activity diagram and wrote the description for the diagram in the .md file.
* Zhengtao: We discussed parts of the sequence diagrams. I coded uml file for the during-task sequence diagram, and wrote the description for my diagram. I also updated hyperlinks in our design markdown file.
