11/30 Sprint Review

11/30 Sprint Review

These last two weeks, we wrote the createTask method and polished the CLI to have a functional way to send robots to clean rooms. We created a thread to add logical time into our program allowing for robots to be unavailable for certain amounts of real time. We changed one of the data structures to fix segfault errors we were having in our thread. Changed the csv to have real data from our program.

What went well:
  - We were able to do a lot of work during this sprint compared to the previous ones.

What did not go well:
  - We could have planned what everyone was doing better.
  - Multiple people that were working together on tasks not communicating well.
    
Plans to improve processes
  - More communciation especially when working on the same tasks.
  - Better planning on what to work on.
  - Be more clear on what tasks are assigned to who.

Individual Contributions
  - Henry:
    I wrote the thread to simulate logical time so that the robots are unavailable for a specific amount of time. After doing this I changed the vectors showing available / unavailable robots to a map to remove errors. I also changed robot battery life to coorelate to robotSize and changed moptime / scrubtime / vaccumtime to coorelate with roomSize. I also changed the CLI to always create Room 0 as a home base. I also helped change createTask to write it in one for-loop. 
    From Standup: Fixed the #include statements in our classes to remove any circular relationship. I also wrote the random number generator for Robot probFailure. I also cleaned up the Room constructors and made sure that the nextID was incrementing properly. I wrote the printCurrentRobots method in Room. I also updated the CLI to use the proper Room constructor which allows it to read inputs as well as cleaned the CLI up visually.
