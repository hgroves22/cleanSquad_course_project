11/30 Sprint Review

These last two weeks, we focused:

What went well:
  - Continuing to have specific work for every person in between meeting sessions. This was part of our plan to improve last sprint review and we think we did really well
      on this.
  - We divided work well: trying to always have four tasks that need to be done before the next meeting/class period. Having four classes to code helped with splitting
      up work evenly.
  - Meeting on Monday's from 5pm - 6pm was very helpful for setting work due dates and catch up on what has been completed and what needs to be done

What did not go well:
  - Our repo organization was not as good as last sprint. We had multiple merge conflicts that we had to resolve (which we did).
  - We were a bit inefficient to start this sprint in terms of work done which we were able to pick up with extra work in the back half of the sprint.
    
Plans to improve processes
  - Starting the sprint strong with tangible tasks we can complete early on.
  - Having stronger communication about what we are working on in our repo to avoid merge conflicts.


Individual Contributions
  - Henry: I wrote the Robot class and header files. I also wrote the print methods for both task and room. I also tested some functionality in our CLI.
  - Zhengtao: I updated some functions in the simulation and robot, and fixed errors. I also made our cmake file and did testing.
  - Lauren: I wrote the Main.cpp program that runs the CLI and wrote the print statements for Simulation. I also fixed errors.
  - Ditrick: I wrote the Task class and header files. I added a output to csv file feature, fixed errors, cleaned repos, and worked on cmake and its testing.
