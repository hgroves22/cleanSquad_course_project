10/26 Sprint Review

For the first two weeks of this project, we focused on the design of the project. 
We first created user stories based off of our PBIs and put them as tickets in "New" in our project backlog. 
From there, we created our initial class diagram which consists of 4 classes: 

  - Robot
  - Simulation
  - Task
  - Room

After we made our class diagrams, we made behavioral diagrams to model how the system would function together. 
We created two sequence diagrams to show how actors interact with each other when assigning a task and during a task. 
We also created an activity diagram to model the flow from one action to another while the simulation is making a task. 
Lastly we put all of the behavioral diagrams in one folder and created a markdown file for these diagrams.
