10/26 Sprint Review

For the first two weeks of this project, we focused on the design of the project. 
We first created user stories based off of our PBIs and put them as tickets in "New" in our project backlog. 
From there, we created our initial class diagram which consists of 4 classes: 

  - Robot
  - Simulation
  - Task
  - Room

After we made our class diagrams, we made behavioral diagrams to model how the system would function together. 
We created two sequence diagrams to show how actors interact with each other when assigning a task and during a task. 
We also created an activity diagram to model the flow from one action to another while the simulation is making a task. 
Lastly we put all of the behavioral diagrams in one folder and created a markdown file for these diagrams.

What went well:
  - We worked well collaboratively creating the designs on whiteboards during group time
  - We divided work well: trying to always have four tasks that need to be done before the next meeting/class period
  - Meeting on Monday's from 5pm - 6pm was very helpful for setting work due dates and catch up on what has been completed and what needs to be done

What did not go well:
  - We need to have better communication when we are not together
  - Though we started doing this at the end, we did not use the cards/issues properly at the beginning of the project

Plans to improve processes
  - Continuing to have specific work for every person in between meeting sessions
    - Even if two people are working on the same task, it is good to be organized and have everyone assigned to certain work
  - Communicating better when we are not together to be more organized about what work has been completed
