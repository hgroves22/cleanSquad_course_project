- Henry: Fixed the #include statements in our classes to remove any circular relationship. I also wrote the random number generator for Robot probFailure. I also cleaned up the Room constructors and made sure that the nextID was incrementing properly. I wrote the printCurrentRobots method in Room. I also updated the CLI to use the proper Room constructor which allows it to read inputs as well as cleaned the CLI up visually.
