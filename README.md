# Simulated Cleaning Robot Fleet Management System

## A fully functional management system written in C++ that allows the user to work with a CLI to send designed robots to clean simulated rooms.

This project was developed by me and three classmates as part of our Software Engineering elective  in the fall of 2023. Throughout the four-month project, we applied the Scrum framework to learn and implement effective Agile development practices.

Here are the main functions that are available to the user with this program:
### Default or Custom Simulation: 
* At the start of the program, the user will be prompted to choose either a default simulation, or create a custom simulation.The default simulation generates 12 robots: one of each size (small, medium, large) and type (mopper, vacuum, scrubber), as well as an additional large robot of each type to help demonstrate the program. It also generates 6 rooms:
+ `docs` - this [folder](docs/README.md) maintains **all** of your project documentation: `puml` files and `README`s. You will have deliverables that require updating this documentation.
+ `include` - the [include](include/INCLUDE.md) files for the libraries your team makes
+ `src` - the [source](src/SRC.md) files for libraries you decide to split out the implementation
+ `app` - the [main application(s)](app/APP.md) of the project
+ `tests` - a battery of [tests](tests/TESTS.md) tests for your libraries and app
