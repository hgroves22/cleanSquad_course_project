# Simulated Cleaning Robot Fleet Management System

## A fully functional management system written in C++ that allows the user to work with a CLI to send designed robots to clean simulated rooms.

This project was developed by me and three classmates as part of our Software Engineering elective  in the fall of 2023. Throughout the four-month project, we applied the Scrum framwork to learn and implement effective Agile development practices.

Here are the main directories you need to worry about this semester:
+ `docs` - this [folder](docs/README.md) maintains **all** of your project documentation: `puml` files and `README`s. You will have deliverables that require updating this documentation.
+ `include` - the [include](include/INCLUDE.md) files for the libraries your team makes
+ `src` - the [source](src/SRC.md) files for libraries you decide to split out the implementation
+ `app` - the [main application(s)](app/APP.md) of the project
+ `tests` - a battery of [tests](tests/TESTS.md) tests for your libraries and app

## Code Management

Your development must take place on your `integration` branch and *any* feature branches you make!
Given the work below, you must decompose it into smaller feature chunks and generate issues for each one. 
These issues will become a branch from `integration` using the same naming scheme as you did in the Team Contract practicum.
When your team is ready to submit new code to me for review, you will submit a PR from `integration` to `main` and **add me as a reviewer**.
**If this process is not followed, you will not earn all of your points for Github Management!**
